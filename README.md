## GFontAPI

Something I build because I wanted to learn some Rust, and also because I got tired of manually downloading and running font converters for every google font I wanted to use in my web applications. Supports adding any google font, creates a `fonts.css` file to allow you to use all the downloaded font variants and styles.

You need a google developer API key in order for it to work, that can be generated by one of the links on [this page](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api). You have to surround the font with double (or single) quotes especially for multi-word fonts. 


### Example usage

I'm working on an install script, for now it requires you to clone the repo and
run `cargo build --release`.

Here's an example of how you can use it. `gfontapi 'Inter'`, `gfontapi 'DM Sans'`.


### Prerequisites

You need the `woff2_compress` binary installed on your system, the installation for which can be found [here](https://github.com/google/woff2/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#build). Move the built binary to either `/usr/local/bin/` or `~/.gfontapi/bin/`
