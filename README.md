### `gfontapi`

Something I build because I wanted to learn some Rust, and also because I got tired of manually downloading and running font converters for every google font I wanted to use in my web applications. Supports adding any google font, creates a `fonts.css` file to allow you to use all the downloaded font variants and styles.

You need a google developer API key in order for it to work, that can be generated by one of the links on [this page](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api). You have to surround the font with double (or single) quotes especially for multi-word fonts.
